# Challenges faced

At first the app wasn't working at all and took total for 4 days to debug. Final problem I faced was that after login `userData` was stored in redux state but wasn't showing until I would refresh the page once after login. I tried multiple approaches to fix it but at last was bound to hotfix it by adding `window.reload` after login.

Any suggestion/issue is appreciated and can be raised in the GitHub issues section.
